            Our new router is also live. Well, at least the first version of it. We decided to split
            to few versions. The reason for that is that we are a small team of three developers, so
            it is expensive time wise to keep tasks ongoing for too long. We also wanted to leverage
            a part of this new router to improve the UX on our site for the Copenhagen launch. My
            mental model regarding this new way of structuring router and the data fetching is
            always getting clearer. I look forward to continuing to refactoring our code to to use
            more of this new react-router version.

            It's built in TypeScript, React, chakra-ui and react-query. I'm working on the frontend
            part of the project. They do also have an app built in Flutter. I don't have any
            experience with Flutter, but it would be fun to get experience and learn something new.

            I'm not very experienced at writing code in TypeScript but, I want to improve so this is
            a grate opportunity to get better. The guys who build the gigOver site did a good job
            and I hope that I'm not ruining the codebase too much with my sloppy TS code ðŸ˜¬.

          It's not the best system in the world but it helps me a lot to keep control over the

          system.
