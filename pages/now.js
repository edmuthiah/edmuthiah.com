            We've been spending are getting ready to launch in Copenhagen ðŸ¥³. We have great people
            on the ground setting things up and getting ready. It's so much fun to take part in
            something like this. I'm really excited to see how it goes.

            The biggest task I'm working on is re-writing our router. We use react-router like so
            many other websites, they release and interesting updates a while ago. This project is a
            big one, since it touches on a lot of things in our codebase. I think the new mental
            model with the actions and loader is way more clearer. The biggest pros in thise update
            is that it's going to remove some of the problems we have been dealing with.

            I like the execute programming method of courses since they use spaced-repition. I
            believe that is on of the best way to learn.

            It's built in TypeScript, React, chakra-ui and react-query. I'm working on the frontend
            part of the project. They do also have an app built in Flutter. I don't have any
            experience with Flutter, but it would be fun to get experience and learn something new.

            I'm thinking about if I should start to re-write my blog to TypeScript. Like I mentioned
            I want to improve my TypeScript skill, so a real deliberate practice will help greatly.
            It will depend on what time I have. Since I started working as a contractor I have less
            extra time. But it would be a good project to work on it over longer time-period. Don't
            understimate the work done in small chunks but over long time.
